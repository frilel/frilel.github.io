										<h2>The course</h2>
										<p>
											The project was done for a master's course called <i>Computer Graphics and Interaction</i>.
											As our professor said "A big part of Computer Graphics and Interaction is math-programming".
											I chose to focus on the	interaction side of it, which to a big degree is about simulating physics
											and motion. The course consisted of both some interesting lab assignments and a larger project. 
										</p>

								<h2>The Project - Graded A</h2>
								</div>
								
								<p>
									Since I had previously been responsible for programming collision handling in previous game development projects I was curious
									about learning more of how collision algorithms work. In my research I learned that an algorithm called GJK is a fundamental piece 
									and I decided to try and implement this in Unity as a plugin. Many online descriptions of the algorithm omitted the
									computation of closest points between objects and was usually exemplified in 2D. I therefore raised the bar by implementing
									these aspects in my project.
								</p>
								<p>
									As seen in the GIF above, the implementation detects insersection of convex polyhedra, making them red, and draws
									white lines between the closest points of non-intersecting objects.
								</p>
								<p>
									The final report, written as a scientific article submission, can be read here:

									<a href="docs/Implementing_GJK_as_a_plugin_for_Unity-Christian_Lindberg_Project_Report.pdf"><b>[here]</b></a>.)
								</p>

									The code for the GJK algorithm, including computation of closest points, is available here:

									I also kept a blog that sort of documented my work process which can be read

									<h2>Lab Assignments - Graded PASS</h2>

									<div class="image fit"><img src="images/project_GJK/BoundingSphereVolumesIntersection.gif" alt="" /></div>
									<p>
										The course also had some interesting and challenging labs.
										The lab track I chose mainly had me explore programming with <b>OpenGL in C++</b>.
										Some of the notable things I learned was to write basic vector math and <b>quaternion</b> classes. 
										Using these classes I would make OpenGL draw a simple tank 3D model,
										assembled with separate pieces that could be moved with keyboard input.
										Learned how to apply transformations to matrices in OpenGL. This had me learn about how <i>transforms</i>
										and transform hierarcy for animating parts work in detail. I programmed a basic <b>Bounding Volume Hierarcy</b>
										for making penetration/collision tests with, exemplified in the GIF above.
