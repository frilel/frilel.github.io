									<h3>EDUCATION & WORK</h3>
								</p>
								<p>
									Christian is a postgraduate student in Stockholm, Sweden, studying towards a master's degree in visual interactive media technology planned to finish in the Summer of 2023.
								</p>
								<p>
									He graduated with a BSc in Computer- and Systems Science from 
									<a href="https://www.su.se/department-of-computer-and-systems-sciences/">Stockholm University</a>
									 with a major in Game Development.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before graduating his bachelor studies he worked for 10 years as a full-time soldier and vehicle mechanic in the 
									<a href="https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/en/">Swedish Armed Forces</a>. The work was disciplining, character building and a lot was learned about vehicle mechanics, teamwork and leadership. 
									However, reflecting on the future career path, Christian decided to return to his previous studies in Computer Science and
									Game Development in 2020. Aiming for a career in the gaming industry.
									After graduating in 2021 he was admitted to the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, to the international master's program
									<a href="https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/interactive-media-technology">MSc Interactive Media Technology</a>.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
								</p>
								<p>
									I am nerd when it comes to gaming, technology, game development/design etc. Other areas of interest includes Human-Computer Interaction, User Experience, 
									User Research and general research in HCI and Human Behavior. During my bachelor I was mostly focusing on the role of programming during game development projects. 
									However, during my master's I've enjoyed working with design challenges with a user-centric approach. Researching an issue at hand, 
									designing and evaluating a solution with the users in mind. Which there has been a lot of during the master's. 
									I'm ambitious and creative with a disciplined, can do, attitude.
									The right environment for me to be creative is in a small team, where each member is inclusive, open and geeky. I can also work well independently,
									especially for tasks that require zoning out like writing a research report or crunching with programming.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also love cats and boardgames =^_^= Recently I've been DMing Dungeons and Dragons üêâ.
									Which is super fun! 
								</p>
								<p>
									<h3>WHO SHOULD RECRUIT ME?</h3>
								</p>
								<p>
									A gaming studio looking for a designer with technical knowledge and interest in Human-Computer Interaction.
									<br /><br />
									A researcher looking for a PhD applicant in HCI or games research.
									<br /><br />
									Indie game developers who wants to create a startup company or recruit an ambitous co-worker that has worked quite a bit with Unity.
									<br /><br />
									Feel free to contact me for anything else as well! („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•
