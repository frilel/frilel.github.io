									<h3>EDUCATION & WORK</h3>
								</p>
								<p>
									Christian currently lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and has a MSc in Computer Science with a major in Interactive Media Technology (in other words: human-computer interaction) from the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/eecs">Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									He graduated with a BSc in Computer and Systems Science from 
									<a href="https://www.su.se/department-of-computer-and-systems-sciences/">Stockholm University</a>
									 with a major in Game Development.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before embarking on his bachelor's studies, Christian spent a solid decade as a dedicated full-time soldier and skilled vehicle mechanic in the esteemed ranks of the <a href="https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/en/">Swedish Armed Forces</a>. This experience wasn't just a job; it was a profound journey of discipline, personal growth, and a masterclass in all things related to vehicle mechanics, teamwork, and leadership.
								</p>
								<p>
									Pondering his future career path, Christian made the decision to pivot back to his passion for games and technology. In 2020, he rekindled his academic pursuits in Computer Science and Game Development. 
									Graduating with a bachelor of science in 2021 and a master of science in 2023.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2024 he began working for the <a href="https://www.foi.se/">Swedish Defence Research Agency</a>, where he contributes with research and development of combat flight simulation. Work duties include implementing XR technology and gaming engines as image generators, and contributing to human studies revolving around the use of XR for combat flight simulation training.
								</p>
								<p>
									Christian's journey continues to evolve, with a fusion of his military discipline and expertise in the dynamic field of interactive media.
								</p>
								<p>
									<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
								</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/MeLola.jpg" alt="Christian taking a photo of himself smiling and playing the board game Gloomhaven with his cat Lola laying across the table." />
									Me and Lola! =^.^=</div>
								<p>
									I proudly wear my nerd badge. Whether it's diving deep into gaming, exploring the latest tech trends, or conjuring up fantastical worlds in my mind! My interests range from game development and design to the enchanting realms of fantasy and the boundless wonders of sci-fi. When I'm not exploring virtual dungeons you'll find me mastering a different kind of dungeon ‚Äî Dungeons and Dragons that is üêâ! As a Dungeon Master, I'm running unforgettable tales and lead my fellow adventurers on epic journeys.
								</p>
								<p>
									Academically, I'm also deeply fascinated by the complex world of Human-Computer Interaction, including topics such as user-experience, user-research, and user-motivation. You could say I'm on a quest to decode the intricate dance of human behavior with technology.
								</p>
								<p>
									In my undergrad days, I was all about programming my way through epic game development adventures. However, my master's journey introduced me to the world of design challenges and human study research, embracing a user-centric approach. Tackling problems and crafting solutions with the users always in mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ambitious, creative, and disciplined ‚Äî that's me in a nutshell. I'm a 'can-do' kind of person, always up for a challenge. My ideal playground? A small, tight-knit team where everyone's not just inclusive but proudly geeky. Of course, I'm no stranger to solo quests either. Give me a problem to resolve or some serious programming to tackle, and I'll happily zone out, headphones on, and coffee at the ready.
								</p>
								<p>
									So, whether it's slaying code dragons, exploring the uncharted territories of design, or embarking on a new research quest, count me in! Let's create something awesome together, live long and prosper!
								</p>
								<p>
									Oh, and did I mention my love for cats? =^_^= They're like real-life companions on my epic quests.
