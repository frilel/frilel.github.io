									<b>EDUCATION & WORK</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									Christian is a postgraduate student in Stockholm, Sweden, studying for a master's degree in visual interactive media technology planned to finish in the Summer 2023.
								</p>
								<p>
									He graduated with a BS in Computer- and Data Science from 
									<a href="https://www.su.se/department-of-computer-and-systems-sciences/">Stockholm University</a>
									 with a major in Game Development.
									</p>
								<p>
									Before graduating his bachelor studies he worked for 10 years as a full-time soldier and vehicle mechanic in the 
									<a href="https://www.forsvarsmakten.se/en/">Swedish Armed Forces</a>. Learning the virtue of discipline and hard work.
									Wanting more intellectually challenging and stimulating work, combining his passion for games, 
									Christian resumed his earlier studies in Computer Science and Game Development in 2020, graduating in 2021.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>WHO AM I?</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									I am nerd when it comes to Computer Game Development/Design. Other areas of interest including Human-Computer Interaction, User Experience, 
									User Research and general research in HCI and Human Behavior. During my bachelor I was mostly focusing on programming from a game dev standpoint. 
									However, during my master's I've enjoyed working with design challenges with a user-centric approach. Researching an issue at hand, 
									designing and evaluating a solution with the users in mind. Which there has been a lot of during the master's. 
									I am ambitous and creative with a disciplined can do attitude in the right environment.
									The right environment for me to be creative is in a small team, where each member is inclusive, open and geeky. I can also work well independently,
									especially for tasks that require one to zone out like writing a research report or crunch with programming. So I enjoy both engineering, designing and research.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also love cats and boardgames =^_^=
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>WHO SHOULD RECRUIT ME?</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									A gaming company looking for a designer with technical knowledge, interest in UX and User Research and a strong drive to create value for the company.
									<br />
									An academic researcher looking for PhD applicants in HCI or games research.
									<br />
									A group of indie game developers who wants to create a startup company.
