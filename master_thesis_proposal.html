								<h2>Designing a sustainable and ethical monetization scheme in a free to play game</h2>
								</div>
								This is just my general study proposal, it needs more work and can/will change more or less of course. If Embark has another idea or problem to propose I am all ears =)
								<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This thesis would be investigating how free-to-play games could be using more ethical and sustainable monetization/reward schemes that are integrated in the gameplay. Meaning that the focus is not on the overall monetization model such as subscription services, in-game advertisement, or commodification of user data. Focus would be on schemes that the player interacts with in the game core loop, e.g., reward schemes such as loot boxes.
<br><br>There would be three stages. First, conducting a literature study to create design guidelines. Second, create one or more prototypes based on the guidelines. Third, evaluate the prototypes on users with an emphasis on the user experience.
<br><br>In this proposed study, Embark could contribute with expertise in the area and focus could be directed towards one of their games that are currently under development, with the design solutions being aimed towards one of those games.
<br><br><h2>Background</h2>
"Predatory monetization" schemes, e.g., loot boxes, are often used in free-to-play games, and are being debated in academia and media [1], [2]. The public is becoming more aware of these techniques, and the games using them. For example, with the release of Diablo Immortal this year, many gamers gave it heavy critique for its monetization schemes [3]. Logically, this could hurt the reputation of the gaming company and their retention of players.
<br><br>Free-to-play monetization is heavily engaged in motivational design. There are two fundamental views on motivation, extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic coming from the environment (e.g., being given food to do something) and intrinsic coming from within oneself (e.g., doing something because it is honorable). Monetization schemes such as loot boxes mostly rely on the ‘variable ratio reward schedule’, coined by the behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner, and is said to be the most ‘addictive’ schedule of extrinsic motivation [4]. Loot boxes, and many other monetization tricks [5], raise ethical concerns as the design become manipulative rather than motivational. Meaning that the self-interest of the user is disregarded.
<br><br>A recent literature review on free-to-play game research [6] showed that research has focused mostly on behavioral economics and aspects of how to maximize player bases and profits. Leaving out aspects such as meaningful game experiences and societal implications.
<br><br>Many game design methods and patterns are based on norms of what constitutes a good playing experience, and they are mostly based on analyses on developed games [7]. This could lead to a designer being engaged in “cargo cult” design [8]. Design methods, from general design research, focusing on the design or development process could avoid following norms [9].
<br><br><h2>Problem</h2>
It is unclear how more sustainable monetization schemes could be designed and be integrated in a gameplay loop. The research question to investigate is as follows.
<br><br>RQ 1: What are some examples of predatory monetization schemes and what guidelines could more sustainable monetization schemes follow?
<br><br>RQ 2: How could a sustainable monetization scheme be integrated with gameplay loop and provide a good, ethical, player experience? 
<br><br><h2>Method</h2>
I will first conduct a literature study on monetization schemes in relation to human psychology, building (if not found in literature) a set of guidelines for designing more sustainable monetization schemes.
<br><br>Then I will engage in research through (game) design by prototyping one, or more, gameplay mechanics with an integrated monetization scheme. The design research will be conducted as reflection-in-action, where the design process will help construct new knowledge.
<br><br>The prototype will finally be evaluated with user testing, focusing on a qualitative approach to measure the UX.
<br><br>The thesis will delimit itself by not looking at aspects of economic value, e.g., evaluate what design would give more profit.
<br><br><h2>Plan</h2>
The "official" semester is 20 weeks long from 9 January to 28 May 2023. My plan is to begin work 2 January and have the thesis defended at the latest in June 2023.
